# Development log

### update 1     16/11/2019

I have created loading screen code, main menu and encode, decode methods.
I had intended to add a larger number of features and use more gems by this stage, but i ran into some problems with the encode method.
It was due to a simple mistake in calling variables into the main menu and ended up being an easy fix.

### update 2      21/11/2019

I was trying to fix special character conversion for encode function.
I was advised top leave it until documentation was completed as time was running short.
I will add a rescue to keep the app running as a short term fix.
Overall i have found myself focusing too much on the coding. I need to change my mindset to take a broader view of the entire project.
