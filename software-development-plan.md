# Software Development Plan 

Code EnCode is an application for encoding messages. It allows for a secret exchange of encoded texts between friends without the need for a private or encrypted platform. Code EnCode uses a combination of the last 3 digits of your phone number and the last 3 digits of the recipients phone number to encode you message. Messages are decoded by providing the same information. 
Often the contents of our messages are personal or intended for just one person. This app will allow encoded communication between these parties without the need to remember passwords.


 ## *Our users are highly paranoid conspiracy theorists and in the event of a government instigated zombie apocalypse a secure yet simple encoded messaging system for our simple minded users is a must.* 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Our slightly unhinged users will run the application from their bunkers between bouts of flu and measles, unless they have been vaccinated, in which case they will not use the application, having already become docile and compliant.

--------------------------------------------------------------

### ***The lack of fast internet will make voice or video communication untenable. Standard encryption was all created by government for eavesdropping and is communicated to agents worldwide via contrails. This only leaves Code EnCode. The one remaining pure encoding app.***

--------------------------------------------------------------
Our users enter the last 3 digits of their phone number followed by the last 3 digits of the recipients phone number. 
They are then prompted to enter a message. 
Once the message is completed the digits entered will be used to encode the text making it unreadable.
The user then sends the message to their intended recipient who will use the app to decode the message.
- Users will not be required to enter their entire phone number. 
- Users can save profile information using an alias or first name only
- Users can save profile information of receivers for quicker encoding and decoding.
- Our target audience is undecided on having inbuilt mail functionality. If google mail is used it may be necessary to install an evilometer to detect current level of google evilness.
